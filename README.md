This is a simple game and my first code in Javascript.

This game has four files app.js, index.html and style.css and the READ.md.
The game asks you to guess a number in a range of 50, from 1 to 50. You try and if it's the wrong number it messages you if the number is higher or lower.
After you succed on guessing the number, a message pops up showing the number and the number of tries you did.
The Html and Css of this game is modern, blue and shows a sided high tech woman.

Thanks for visiting and have fun!
